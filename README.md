# Get-It-c64-basic

Get It was a game I made in 2018 that I wrote using scratch. https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/249283253/.

The rules of the game are simple. You can steal coins from the other player or you can earn coins, but you can also skip your turn.

# What did I do with the game now?

I ported the game to Commodore Basic Version 2 in 10 lines!

I was just bored
